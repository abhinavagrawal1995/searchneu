# Frontend

The frontend was made with React and Webpack. Redux isn't used at the moment but may be used in the future. All of the react components are located in `frontend/components`. All of the static files (robots.txt, etc) are located in `frontend/static`.

### Home.js

Home.js is the main React component in Search NEU. It handles many different event listeners such as the back and forward buttons in the browser, the search box events, and the term selector events. When a user searches for a query, Home.js fetches the results from the server with `Search.js` and then sends the results to `ResultsLoader.js` to be rendered. 

# The Panels

## Classes

The class panels are responsible for rendering one class results on either mobile or desktop. 

### Desktop Class Panel
