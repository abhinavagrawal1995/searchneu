Learning a new thing can be scary. Especially when all you have are some docs and a massive code base to learn from. That's why we are here to help you learn, build, and contribute. Ask us questions! hey@searchneu.com

# Tutorials and Resources

## Learning the Backend

**Node.js** is a JavaScript runtime that lets you run JavaScript on a server. This lets us use the same libraries and pieces of code in both the frontend and the backend. It is used all over the tech industry by companies like Netflix, PayPal, Uber, and the New York Times!

I'm sure there are some great Node.js tutorials out there, but am not aware of any of the top of my head. If you find a great one, drop us a line! hey@searchneu.com

## Learning React

React is a JavaScript library created by Facebook for "building user interfaces". It allows developers to make encapsulated components that can be written once and used anywhere. 

If you're a beginner, we recommend checking out [Semester.ly's React tutorial](https://github.com/noahpresler/React-Tutorial) that will teach you the basics of developing a React app all via codepen. This is a great way to get started! 

We highly recommend continuing with React via [EggHead's React Fundamentals video](https://egghead.io/courses/react-fundamentals>) which teaches you everything you'll need to know.

Finally, finish off with [EggHead's Redux tutorial](https://egghead.io/courses/getting-started-with-redux>). You'll be a pro after that! 

## Learning CSS

The most important step is to [learn the CSS basics](https://www.w3schools.com/css/).

For development, we use a modified version of the [Airbnb style guide](https://github.com/airbnb/css).
